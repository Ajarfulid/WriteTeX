WriteTeX
========
<img src=https://github.com/wanglongqi/WriteTeX/raw/master/writetex.png width=300px alt=Logo>

An Inkscape extension: Latex/Tex editor for Inkscape, inspired by [textext](http://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/).

This extension uses Inkscape build-in extension system, does not require TK or PyGtk as textext. Live preview feature is supported. You can obtain orginal TeX source from View Old Text tab. 

## Installation
Just drop `writetex.py` and `writetex.inx` to Inkscape extension folder, which is normally at `$inkscapeFolder$/share/extensions`. Make sure `XeLatex` and `PDF2SVG` or `PDFtoEDIT` are in you path. 

### Binaries for PDFTOSVG converter
For ease of the users, I also provide unofficial PDFTOSVG binaries for Windows and Mac OSX users. 

- For **Windows** user, binary version of *pdf2svg* is provided.
- For **Mac OSX** user, binary version of both *pstoedit* and *pdf2svg* are provided.
- For **Linux** and other OS, *pdf2svg* or *pstoedit* usually can be installed from default package manager.

## Usage

### 1. Latex text input
The basic UI is like this:

![UI](https://github.com/wanglongqi/WriteTeX/raw/master/images/ui.png)

By default, WriteTeX use XeLatex to convert text to pdf. If you wish to use pdflatex, just change the command in the code. You can use PDF2SVG or PDFtoEDIt to convert PDF to SVG. There are slightly difference in trading SVGs generated by PDF2SVG and PDFtoEDIT.

Normally, WriteTeX trys to keep transform in old and new object. But you can overide this behaviour by check the Rescale checkbox, which will rescale the object by current scale factor accordingly.

### 2. Input from file
For long text, you may want to edit it in your TeX editor. You only need to write the body of the text. Paste the path of the file in to the EditBox. If you want to specify preamble file, specify it in the Preamble File EditBox. Then you are good to go.

### 3. View old tex strings

Due to the limitation of Inkscape build-in extension system, I cannot set default TeX Text as the orignal TeX string. Therefore, we have this bypass function. If you want to edit the orignal TeX strings, use this function to obtain you orignal TeX Strings. Then edit the strings. Here is a demo on obtain orginal TeX strings:

If there are other ways to do so, please tell me.

### 4. Customize `latex` command
