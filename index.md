Theoretically, Inkscape supports import pdf text as path in the lastest version. This extension should be expired. If you still think this plugin is useful, please star this project in the [github repository](//git.writetex.tk). It helps me to evaluate whether this plugin is needed anymore. Thanks! 

理论上讲，新版的Inkscape已经支持将PDF中文字导入为路径，这个插件的功能应该已经过时。如果你仍然觉得这个插件有用，请在项目[源代码库](//git.writetex.tk)star这个项目，这可以帮助我了解这个插件的需求。谢谢！

An Inkscape extension: Latex/Tex editor for Inkscape, inspired by [textext](http://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/).

This extension uses Inkscape build-in extension system, does not require TK or PyGtk as textext. Live preview feature is supported. You can obtain original TeX source from View Original TeX tab.

## Installation
Just drop `writetex.py` and `writetex.inx` to Inkscape extension folder, which is normally at `$inkscapeFolder$/share/extensions`. Make sure you have at least one **LaTeX** command and one **PDFtoSVG** converter are in your path. The lastest release can be downloaded from [*here*](https://github.com/wanglongqi/WriteTeX/releases/latest).

### Binaries for PDFTOSVG converter
For ease of the users, I also provide unofficial PDFTOSVG binaries for Windows and Mac OSX users.

- For **Windows** user, binary version of *pdf2svg* is provided.
- For **Mac OSX** user, binary version of both *pstoedit* and *pdf2svg* are provided.
- For **Linux** and other OS, *pdf2svg* or *pstoedit* usually can be installed from default package manager.

## Usage

### 1. Latex text input
The basic UI is like this:

![UI](/images/t1.png)

By default, WriteTeX use XeLatex to convert text to pdf. If you wish to use pdflatex, just change the command in the code. You can use PDF2SVG or PDFtoEDIt to convert PDF to SVG. There are slightly difference in trading SVGs generated by PDF2SVG and PDFtoEDIT.

Normally, WriteTeX trys to keep transform in old and new object. But you can override this behavior by check the Rescale checkbox, which will rescale the object by current scale factor accordingly.

### 2. Input from file
For long text, you may want to edit it in your TeX editor. You only need to write the body of the text. Paste the path of the file in to the EditBox. If you want to specify preamble file, specify it in the Preamble File EditBox. Then you are good to go.

### 3. View original TeX string

Due to the limitation of Inkscape build-in extension system, I cannot set default TeX Text as the original TeX string. Therefore, we have this bypass function. If you want to edit the original TeX strings, use this function to obtain you original TeX Strings. Then edit the strings. Here is a demo on obtain original TeX strings:

From v1.5 on, the text can also be directly written to the current layer:

### 4. Customize `latex` command

Detailed information can be found in [this page](./latexcmd.html).
