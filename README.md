An Inkscape extension: Latex/Tex editor for Inkscape, inspired by [textext](http://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/).

This extension uses Inkscape build-in extension system, does not require TK or PyGtk as textext. Live preview feature is supported. You can obtain orginal TeX source from View Old Text tab. 

## Installation
Just drop `writetex.py` and `writetex.inx` to Inkscape extension folder, which is normally at `$inkscapeFolder$/share/extensions`. Make sure `XeLatex` and `PDF2SVG` or `PDFtoEDIT` are in you path.
