WriteTeX
========

An Inkscape extension: Latex/Tex editor for Inkscape, inspired by [textext](http://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/).


This extension uses Inkscape build-in extension system, no require TK or PyGtk as textext does. Live preview feature is supported. You can obtain old tex sourse from View Old Text tab. More detail usage will be uploaded lately.


## Usage
Just drop writetex.py and writetex.inx to Inkscape extension folder, which is normally at $inkscapeFolder$/share/extensions. Make sure XeLatex and PDF2SVG or PDFtoEDIT in you path.

### 1. Latex text input
The basic UI is like this:

By default, WriteTeX use XeLatex to convert text to pdf. If you wish to use pdflatex, just change the command in the code. You can use PDF2SVG or PDFtoEDIt to convert PDF to SVG. There are slightly difference in trading SVGs generated by PDF2SVG and PDFtoEDIT. Meanwhile, you can dowload Windows Binary version of PDF2SVG from [here](https://github.com/wanglongqi/WriteTeX/raw/master/plot2svg.7z). The source code of PDF2SVG can be found [here](www.cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg).

### 2. Input from file
For long text, you may want to edit it in your TeX editor. You need just write the body of the text. Paste the path of the file in to the EditBox. If you want to specify preamble file, specify it in the Preamble File EditBox. Then you are good to go.

### 3. View old tex strings

Due to the limitation of Inkscape build-in extension system, I cannot set default TeX Text as the old TeX string. Therefore, we have the bypass function. If you want to edit the old TeX strings, use this function to obtain you old TeX Strings. Then edit the old strings. If there are other ways to do so, please tell me.
